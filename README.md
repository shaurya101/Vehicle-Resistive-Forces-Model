# Vehicle-Resistive-Forces-Model 

Simulating and Modelling vehicle resistive forces for three different tracks using Scilab-Xcox.

The following forces were modelled :
---Aerodynamic force
---Gradient force
---Rolling resistance force
---Acceleration force

Also,
--- Wheel speed and Wheel Torque were obtained


IMPORTANT---Import all the above files into one directory and open the same directory in Scilab.


%%%%%%%% For Track 1 %%%%%%%%

* Open "Vehicle Resistive forces xcos model.zcos" in Xcos.
* Run the "Imports_track1.sce"  to import track data 1 into the Scilab workspace.
* Copy the code provided in "Set context.pdf" in Xcos--> Simulation-->Set context
* Run the simulation 
* The respective results and graph are obtained.

==========================================

%%%%%%%%% For Track 2 %%%%%%%%

* Open "Vehicle Resistive forces xcos model.zcos" in Xcos.
* Run the "Imports_track2.sce"  to import track data 2 into the Scilab workspace.
* Copy the code provided in "Set context.pdf" in Xcos--> Simulation-->Set context
* Run the simulation 
* The respective results and graph are obtained.

==========================================

%%%%%%%%% For Track 3 %%%%%%%%

* Open "Vehicle Resistive forces xcos model.zcos" in Xcos.
* Run the "Imports_track3.sce"  to import track data 3 into the Scilab workspace.
* Copy the code provided in "Set context.pdf" in Xcos--> Simulation-->Set context
* Run the simulation 
* The respective results and graph are obtained.
